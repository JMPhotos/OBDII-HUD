# ARDUINO

These files contribute the code to making the Arduino microcontroller work. 

# FILE DESCRIPTIONS
 **1. _EEPROM Memory Addressing_** - Listing of data stored to Arduino's memory
 
 **2. _BluefruitConfig.h_** - Configuration data for the Adafruit BLE Shield
 
 **3. _HUD.ino_** - Main code file for the Arduino microcontroller

**NOTE:** In addition to these files, you will also need to download the OBD2UART library and save it to your Arduino libraries folder. https://github.com/stanleyhuangyc/ArduinoOBD/tree/master/libraries/OBD2UART
