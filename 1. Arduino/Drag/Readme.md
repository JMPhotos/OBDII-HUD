These files contribute the code to making the Arduino microcontroller:
Read OBD-II data from the vehicle Illuminate the appropriate NeoPixels as the RPM increases

FILE DESCRIPTIONS 
Drag.ino - Main code file for the Arduino microcontroller.

NOTE: This version is a hardcoded version of the Tach Mode HUD type. Any changes to the HUD require modifying and reloading the code.

NOTE 2: All colors are in Red Green Blue format and take values between 0 and 255. You can use an online color picker to determine the rgb values for any color you want. https://rgbcolorcode.com/

NOTE 3: In addition to these files, you will also need to download the OBDUART library. https://github.com/stanleyhuangyc/ArduinoOBD/tree/master/libraries/OBD2UART
