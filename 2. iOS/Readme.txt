iOS

These files contribute the code to making the iOS application:
 1. Connect and read data from the Arduino
 2. Configure the Arduino to display a HUD in 1 of 3 configurations:
    a. Tachometer Mode - LEDs light sequentially from 1000 to the Redline value.
    b. Track Mode - LEDs light from outside to inside, from half of the shift value to the shift value.
    c. Drag Mode - Entire LEDs bar illuminates if RPM is over the shift value.
