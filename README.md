# OBDII-HUD
This project was created to provide a Shelby GT350-styled shift light to the standard S550 Mustang. Unlike the Shelby HUD, which operates over a CANBUS signal generated by the instrument cluster, this HUD operates by an Arduino that reads OBDII data and illuminates its own LED strip. As a result, this HUD is capable of multiple configurable colors, compared to the Shelby's single color.

### Parts Needed

- Arduino UNO (or similar)
- Adafruit BLE Shield
- Freematics OBDII UART v2.1
- Neopixel strip 144/m
- Defroster Grille - HR3Z-63044E82-AA
- HUD Module - FR3Z-19G468-A



### Folder Descriptions

1. Arduino - Contains the source code for the Arduino microcontroller. Includes hard-coded versions that don't require the iOS app 
2. iOS - ~~Contains the source code for the iOS app.~~ **TO BE ADDED** Since I don't want to spend the $100 per year to publish the application on Apple's App Store, this app will only be distributed via source code. You'll need a Mac computer with XCode in order to compile it and run it on your device.
